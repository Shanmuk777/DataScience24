    "Answer: The key features of Python are :\n",
    "1. Easy to use, read, and learn -> This is because Python's syntax is straightforward, clear and easy to read, making it a default language for both beginners and experienced programmers. This programming language is also used to lead projects to faster development and reduce major and minor errors.\n",
    "2. High-level programming language -> It means human readable code.\n",
    "3. Open-Source programming language -> Python is free to download in other words it is a freely available programming language on the internet anyone can access without any cost.\n",
    "4. The python programming can be widely used in the technical industries. Mainly it can be used in the data handling industries i.e. for Data Science, Data Analysis, Business Analysis, Data Engineering etc.\n",
    "5. Versatility -> Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used for a wide variety of applications. Whether you’re working on web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, or automation, Python has a large number of libraries and frameworks to support these tasks.\n",
    "6. Extensive Standard Library -> Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides modules and functions for various tasks, such as file handling, regular expressions, and web services. This reduces the need to write code from scratch and speeds up development.\n",
    "7. Community Support -> Python has a large and active community that contributes to a wealth of resources, including tutorials, documentation, and forums. This strong community support means that developers can easily find help and collaborate with others.\n",
    "8. Cross-Platform Compatibility -> Python runs on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. This cross-platform compatibility ensures that Python applications can be developed and executed on different systems without modification.\n",
    "9. Object-Oriented and Functional Programming -> Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming. This flexibility allows developers to use the most suitable approach for their tasks.\n",
    "10. Large Ecosystem of Libraries and Frameworks -> Python has a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks, which makes it easier to build complex applications. Popular libraries include NumPy and Pandas for data analysis, Django and Flask for web development, and TensorFlow and PyTorch for machine learning.\n",
    "11. Dynamic Typing -> Python uses dynamic typing, meaning that you don’t need to declare the type of a variable when you create it. This feature allows for more flexibility and faster coding but requires careful attention to avoid type-related bugs.\n",
    "12. Interpreted Language -> Python is an interpreted language, meaning that code is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier and speeds up the development cycle. This also means you don't need to compile your code before running it."
